title: "Authentication"
---

Some API endpoints are protected, and therefore require that you authenticate using an API token.

## Generate a token from Enzo

1. Navigate to your workflow dashboard (https://app.enzo.health)
2. Click on Settings & Members > My account
3. Under the "API tokens" section, click on "Create"
4. Give it a name, then click on "Create token"
5. Copy your token.


## Generating a Token via POST Request

To generate a token programmatically, use the following POST request:
```sh
curl -v -X POST 'https://app.enzo.health/api/auth/rest' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"email":"your@email.com", "password":"YOUR_PASSWORD"}'
```

## Use your token

You can authenticate by adding an `Authorization` header to all your HTTP calls. The Authorization header is formatted as such: `Authorization: <token>` (replace `<token>` with your token previously generated).

Example:

```sh
curl -L -X GET 'https://app.enzo.health/api/workflows/:workflowId/results' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: yourToken'
```
